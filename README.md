# 🌀 Useless Websites

Welcome to **Useless Websites**, a collection of totally random, mostly pointless, but strangely entertaining web experiments.
Click a button, land on a surprise. That's it. That's the magic.

## 🌐 About

This is a small fun project made to bring joy, distraction, and some good old internet chaos. Every page in this repo is a different “useless” mini-site — from flipping cards to popping bubble wrap, translating chicken language, and even a binary music player.

## 📄 Pages Included

* **Fall Page** – Watch objects fall endlessly for no apparent reason.
* **Flip Card Game** – Test your memory in this simple, addictive flip card game.
* **Chicken Translator** – Type anything and get it translated into pure chicken.
* **Bubble Wrap** – Pop digital bubble wrap forever. Oddly satisfying.
* **Endless Page** – A never-ending scroll page. Seriously, it never stops.
* **Draw Page** – A mini drawing canvas with pen, eraser, and adjustable brush size.
* **Binary Music Player** – Converts numbers into binary and plays notes based on the bits.

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Clone this repo.
2. Open any `.html` file in your browser.
3. Click, scroll, draw, translate... just don’t expect anything productive.
4. (Optional) Link them together with a button that sends users to a random page on each click.

## 🧠 Why?

Because the internet needs more chaos. And sometimes, you just want to waste time in the most entertaining way possible.
